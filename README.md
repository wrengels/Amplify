Amplify 3.2
=============

Amplify is a freeware Macintosh program for simulating and testing polymerase chain reactions (PCRs). It can also be used as a tool for designing primers by evaluating candidates. If you don't know what all this means, then you have no use for Amplify.

This version sort of works with MacOS X 10.7 and later, but it is missing some features. In particular, the online Help features are no longer functional. So do not click on the question-mark icons. Doing so will cause a crash.

In the next few months I hope to rewrite Amplify completely using the new "Swift" programming language from Apple. Meanwhile, version 3.2 should at least do the main tasks of simulating PCR, showing primer matches, etc.
